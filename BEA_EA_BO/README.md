## Time Efficiency in Optimization with a Bayesian-Evolutionary Algorithm

This repository provides code for the following paper:
Gongjin Lan, Jakub M. Tomczak, Diederik M. Roijers, A.E. Eiben, "Time Efficiency in Optimization with a Bayesian-Evolutionary Algorithm", 2020 (under review)

Here, we provide an implementation of the algorithms (Bayesian Opimization (BO), Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Bayesian-Evolutionary Algorithm) on many test functions and transfer methods intergated.

This paper is also available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09531.pdf)
